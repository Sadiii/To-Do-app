# Todo App Using Nextjs and Chakra Ui

This application keep records of our daily todo tasks, we can check them out by compeleting and also delete tasks after completion. 
For building this app, i have used [nextjs13](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) framework of [React](https://reactjs.org/) which is based on Javascript. And for the user interface i'm using [Chakra Ui](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started/nextjs-guide). Theese are hot tehnologies.


## Features

- Add a todo
- remove a todo
- check or uncheck a todo
- change the theme of interface
- The interface is interactive due to chakra be interactive with some meaningfull colors.



## Deployment

The todo app is deployed on [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/). 
You can check it [here](https://todoapp-by-sadia.vercel.app/)

## Use the Projects

You can clone repository by running the following the command.

```bash
  git clone <repo url>
```
And after locating to the app folder, run the project on your local machine by using the following command

```bash
npm run dev
```
Then install all required dependencies
But you must need to install node js in your local machine because we are running typescript outside browser. So nodejs will act as a transalation engine.
```bash
 npm i
```

You will notice that the project file names are with extension of .tsx. it's because we are using typescript flavour. 

You can Futher perform optimization publish the project on [vercel](https://vercel.com/) using the following command.
```bash
 vercel
```
